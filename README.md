# techcrunch-crawler
A web crawler that crawls on different web pages within the website TechCrunch. The crawler incorporates multi-threading to process multiple web pages from different categories simultaneously. 
Furthermore, these webpagesâ€™ information is scraped using Jsoup, a Java library that works with real-world HTML. The
title, author, URL, content, and data are pulled from each article. The output is formatted into a CSV file using the OpenCSV library.

<sub1>Necessary JAR/Dependencies:</sub1>

Within the main method, you can change any of the four links to fit the categories on TechCrunch
you would like to scrape for the article's information.
